# Layotto Commands Guidelinesï¼š

Layotto provides powerful commands, which makes contribution and local development/test easier. List as below:


## Highlights

+ You can simply run `make all` to format your codes, make style checks, linter checks, unit tests, and build layotto binary for host platform.

+ You can also run `make format` to format your codes. 

+ Run `make check` to make style checks, linter checks, unit tests.

+ Run `make build` to build layotto binary for host platform. 

+ Run `make license` to add licnese headers for all code files, with docker.

> Notice: If you encounter the error "make[1]: *** No rule to make target 'all'. Stop.", it means that the Makefile cannot find this target.
>
> You should refer to the commands provided by `make help`. For example,  You can execute commands like `make lint` `make format` `make test` in place of `make all`, which you think should be used to checked codes locally.

See below commands to know more details or excute `make help`:
