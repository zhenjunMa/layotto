# Layotto GitHub Workflows

This document explains Layotto's four workflows in Github:

+ Layotto Env Pipeline ðŸŒŠ
+ Layotto Dev Pipeline ðŸŒŠ (Before Merged)
+ Layotto Dev Pipeline ðŸŒŠ (After Merged)
+ Layotto Release Pipeline ðŸŒŠ

The workflow contains one or more tasks, It improves the standardization and security of the code in layotto, simplifies repetitive steps of development / build / release. The following is a detailed explanation of the above four workflows.

## Layotto Env Pipeline ðŸŒŠ
